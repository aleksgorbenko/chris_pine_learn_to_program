Exercises from the chapters of the book by Chris Pine: "Learn to Program"
<br>
Some chapters contain my own solutions, some are mainly based on Chris Pine's own solutions, listed at the end of the book.
<br>
I found chapters 9 - 11 quite challenging hence I used solutions provided in the book with some slight variations.
<br>
Overall - it was a great read and most importantly - a great stretch! I highly recommend this book to any novice programmer.
